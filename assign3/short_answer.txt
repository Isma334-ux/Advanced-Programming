Make a Class
------------

Q1: Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1: So, when we refers to Const-correctness, it means when methods and variables that do not modify the state of 
an object are marked as `const`. This help us to prevent any accidental modifications, is more readable, and 
allows the compiler to optimize the program in a better way. It also makes the code easier to understand,
and it indicates which functions or variables are only for read (read-only).

Q2: Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2: Yes. The getter methods (`getName()`, `getAge()`, and `getGPA()`), they are marked as
 `const`, that means they do not modify the object's state. Also, the `displayInfo()` method is also
marked as `const` because it only reads and displays the data of the objects. This ensures that these methods can be 
safely called on `const` objects without causing any unintended side effects.
